**I've never written a line of code in my life.**

Now I ship apps. Still don't know what a for-loop is.

## The Backstory

I spent 13+ years as a recruiter at places like **OpenAI**, **Meta**, and **Google**. Reviewed 50,000+ resumes. Hired thousands of engineers. Watched most people make the *exact same mistakes* on their applications.

So I built a tool to fix that—without learning to code.

Welcome to the vibe coding era. ✨

## 🔨 Things I'm Building

🎯 **[Recruiter in Your Pocket](https://recruiterinyourpocket.com)** — AI-powered resume & LinkedIn feedback. Like having a recruiter in your corner 24/7.

✍️ **[lizishaw.com](https://lizishaw.com)** — My wife Lizi's author platform (yes, I build websites for my wife now).

## 🛠️ My "Stack"

I don't write code. I describe what I want and AI builds it.

- 🤖 Claude (via Codex CLI + Antigravity)
- 💎 Gemini for research
- 💬 ChatGPT for everything else
- ☕ Unreasonable amounts of coffee

If you told me a year ago I'd have a GitHub profile, I'd have laughed at you.
